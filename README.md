# symbolics_core
The core library for the Symbolics symbolic math library

This library allows the creation of mathematical expressions containing *symbols*.
The expressions form a tree, which can be traversed and manipulated with helper libraries.
The library also allows substitution of expressions for symbols,
which can be used to numerically evaluate expressions.
